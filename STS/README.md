# ISS-scale Space Transportation System

## Purpose

The 1:220 Lego Ideas [International Space Station (ISS)](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/international-space-station-21321) comes with a half-scale shuttle.

There are many 1:220 space shuttle MOCs, e.g.:
* [DamoB's](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-66213/DamoB/damobs-iss-scale-space-shuttle);
* [phreaddee's](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-74454/phreaddee/space-shuttle-1220);
* [kehu05's](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-39696/kehu05/1220-iss-visiting-vehicles-compatible-with-set-21321);
* [excalibur115's](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-123909/excalibur115/space-shuttle-1220-scale-lego-ideas-iss-scale);
* [Bricks in Space ones](https://bricksin.space/mods/iss/)...

Yet, none of them captures the proportions of the shuttle right.
In particular, the nose and cockpit are always a bit bulky, and tend to make the shuttle look smaller than it is in real life.

Similar concerns apply to [MuscoviteSandwich's](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-38675/MuscoviteSandwich/1220-space-shuttle-tank-and-srbs) external tank and solid rocket boosters MOC.

## Description

The **ISS-scale Space Transportation System** (STS) MOC consists of a 1:220 space shuttle with external tank and boosters.
It features an openable bay, articulated arm and typical payload.

Given how small the finished model is, it is hard to render smoothly the curved shape of the nose and cockpit.
Efforts have rather been focused on the proportions and overall feel of scale.

## Limitations

To make the bay openable at this scale without impacting too much the exterior shape, hinge plates (2429 & 2430) have been used.
While discrete on the outside, they mean the bay doors are heavy on the inside.
This is an acceptable approximation to me, but it yields a bigger deviation:
the bay door is offset backward by two studs, which is huge at this scale.
An improved design is under study.

An altenate, more true to scale, cockpit was initially proposed, making use of the pentagonal 2x2 plate (27928).
Yet, this part doesn't exist in black or trans-black.

Underneath the nose, a standard jumper (15573) could be replaced with a rounded one (1745) if a black recolor was produced.

At the back of the external tank, an orange dome or dish is missing.
I propose to fall back on a red 4x4 dome brick (65138) for now.
